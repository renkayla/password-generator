## User Story 

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data, I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria. SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater securit.y

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password. WHEN I click the button to generate a password, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
WHEN prompted for password criteria, THEN I select which criteria to include in the password. WHEN prompted for the length of the password, THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. WHEN I answer each prompt, THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. WHEN all prompts are answered, THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. WHEN the password is generated, THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.


## Usage
